    "chapter1Title": "The Starting Point",
    "chapter1Para1": "As a man, I never really paid attention to \"beauty tools\". For me, it was a complex and somewhat... intimidating world. Dozens of products, lengthy routines, vocabulary I didn't understand.",
    "chapter1Para2": "Yet, like many, I felt the effects of stress: long days in front of screens, short nights, drawn features in the morning. I was just looking for a simple way to look fresher and less tired. Nothing complicated.",
    "chapter2Title": "The Discovery",
    "chapter2Para1": "I discovered Gua Sha and Rose Quartz somewhat by chance. At first, I was skeptical. \"Stones for the face? Really?\" But I decided to give it a try.",
    "chapter2Para2": "Not for \"beauty\" in the conventional sense, but for well-being. For the massage, the cold sensation on the skin, the 5-minute relaxation in the evening before sleep. A moment just for me.",
    "chapter2Quote": "It wasn't a beauty routine. It was my moment to disconnect.",
    "chapter3Title": "The Revelation",
    "chapter3Para1": "Within a few days, I not only felt a relaxing benefit, but I saw a difference. Less puffiness under the eyes upon waking. More defined features. Skin that looked healthier, more radiant.",
    "chapter3Para2": "And most importantly, I realized something important: this simple ritual had nothing \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" about it. It was just... human. Taking care of yourself is universal. Why make it a secret or exclusive?",
    "chapter4Title": "The Birth of FETRA",
    "chapter4Intro": "I created FETRA for a simple reason:",
    "chapter4Para1": "To share a universal, effective and honest ritual, for all faces. For everyone who wants to take 5 minutes for themselves, and feel good. Without artifice, without unrealistic promises, without gender barriers.",

    "answer7": "Yes! Rose Quartz is naturally soothing and anti-inflammatory, ideal for sensitive or acne-prone skin. Our oil is 100% natural with no synthetic fragrance. However, if you have severe or inflamed acne, consult your dermatologist before use.",
    "question8": "How do I clean my Rose Quartz tools?",
    "answer8": "Very simple: clean them after each use with lukewarm water and mild soap, then dry with a clean cloth. Once a week, you can disinfect them with a little 70% alcohol. Store them in their provided pouch.",

    "faq1Question": "How do I use the jade roller?",
    "faq1Answer": "After applying your serum or oil, gently roll from the center of your face outward, working from bottom to top. Use the small roller for the eye area and the large roller for cheeks, forehead, and neck. Apply light pressure and repeat each movement 5-10 times.",

    "faq1Question": "How often should I use my kit?",
    "faq1Answer": "Ideally 5 minutes per day for quickly visible results. If you're short on time, use it 10-15 minutes, 3 times per week. Consistency is more important than duration!",
    "faq2Question": "I have acne, can I use the kit?",
    "faq2Answer": "Yes! Lymphatic drainage even helps reduce inflammation. However, avoid areas of active inflammation (red or painful pimples). Massage healthy areas to stimulate circulation and toxin elimination.",

    "faq3Answer": "Use the cold roller after shaving to soothe razor burn! The chilled rose quartz instantly calms irritation and reduces redness. A game-changer for your post-shave routine.",
    "faq4Question": "Will I get bruises?",
    "faq4Answer": "No! If you use the right pressure. The pressure should be gentle yet firm, as if spreading a thick cream. Never painful. If you see lasting redness, you're pressing too hard.",
    "faq5Question": "Can I share my tools with my partner?",
    "faq5Answer": "For hygiene reasons, it's best if everyone has their own kit. However, if you carefully clean the tools after each use (mild soap + warm water + 70% alcohol disinfection), it's possible!",
    "faq6Question": "When will I see results?",
    "faq6Answer": "Immediately for puffiness reduction and radiance (cooling effect). After 1 week for reduction of bags and dark circles. After 2-3 weeks for wrinkle smoothing and feature definition. After 1 month for visible and lasting lift effect.",
