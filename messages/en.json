    "subtitle": "How a personal discovery gave birth to FETRA, a universal and authentic beauty brand.",
    "chapter1Title": "The Starting Point",
    "chapter1Para1": "As a man, I never really paid attention to \"beauty tools\". For me, it was a complex and somewhat... intimidating world. Dozens of products, lengthy routines, vocabulary I didn't understand.",
    "chapter1Para2": "Yet, like many, I felt the effects of stress: long days in front of screens, short nights, drawn features in the morning. I was just looking for a simple way to look fresher and less tired. Nothing complicated.",
    "chapter2Title": "The Discovery",
    "chapter2Para1": "I discovered Gua Sha and Rose Quartz somewhat by chance. At first, I was skeptical. \"Stones for the face? Really?\" But I decided to give it a try.",
    "chapter2Para2": "Not for \"beauty\" in the conventional sense, but for well-being. For the massage, the cold sensation on the skin, the 5-minute relaxation in the evening before sleep. A moment just for me.",
    "chapter2Quote": "It wasn't a beauty routine. It was my moment to disconnect.",
    "chapter3Title": "The Revelation",
    "chapter3Para1": "Within a few days, I not only felt a relaxing benefit, but I <strong>saw a difference</strong>. Less puffiness under the eyes upon waking. More defined features. Skin that looked healthier, more radiant.",
    "chapter3Para2": "And most importantly, I realized something important: this simple ritual had nothing \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" about it. It was just... human. Taking care of yourself is universal. Why make it a secret or exclusive?",
    "chapter4Title": "The Birth of FETRA",
    "chapter4Intro": "I created FETRA for a simple reason:",
    "chapter4Para1": "To share a universal, effective and honest ritual, for all faces. For everyone who wants to take 5 minutes for themselves, and feel good. Without artifice, without unrealistic promises, without gender barriers.",
    "chapter4Para2": "FETRA is not just a beauty kit. It's a moment of pause in your day. It's an invitation to take care of yourself, simply and naturally.",
